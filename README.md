# Book of Imagery

Welcome to the Imago's Book of Imagery, this is a living, open reference for all things satellite imagery—especially as it applies to social science, health, and policy in the UK and beyond. 

## 🛠️ Contributing
The core Imago team will put together the very first version (or issue) of the Book of Imagery to set things in motion. After that, everyone’s welcome to get involved—whether it’s code, documentation, or sharing ideas.
For details on how to contribute—whether you’re part of the Imago core team or from the wider Imago community—just take a look at our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). They’ll guide you through forking the repo, making changes, using our templates, and handling any merge hiccups.
