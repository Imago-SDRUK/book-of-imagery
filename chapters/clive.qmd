## Introduction 

*CLiVE* (Climate Local Vulnerability and Exposure) aims to characterise environmental risk at local scales. 

Climate change is reshaping the geography and intensity of environmental hazards around the
world, including the UK. Rising temperatures are contributing to more frequent and intense heatwaves,
changing rainfall patterns are increasing the likelihood and severity of localised flooding, and warming-induced atmospheric changes are exacerbating episodes of air pollution.

These climate-related hazards do not affect all places
or populations equally. Their impacts are shaped by
the distribution of people and infrastructure, and
by social and economic inequalities that influence
individuals’ capacity to prepare for, cope with, and
recover from, adverse events.

However, our ability to systematically monitor
these risks at the local scale, where impacts are
experienced and decisions are made, remains limited.
Many existing datasets are challenging to access
due to their format or required level of technical
skills. Friendly-to-access formats may fail to capture
subnational variation, are not updated with sufficient
frequency, or overlook key dimensions of risk such as
population exposure and vulnerability.

As a result, local governments, public health agencies
and researchers often lack the actionable data they
need to identify priority areas, design targeted
interventions and monitor progress over time.

## Quantifying local vulnerability and exposure

*CLiVE* is
a new data product designed to address this gap,
providing a scientifically robust, spatially granular
and policy relevant suite of indicators to quantify
environmental risk across the UK. It is grounded in
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) conceptualisation [@klein2014climate], which defines risk as the
interaction of three key components:

- **Hazards**: climate-related physical processes or
events that may cause harm, such as extreme
heat, flooding, or elevated levels of air pollution.\

- **Exposure**: the presence of people, assets or
systems in locations that could be adversely
affected by those hazards.\

- **Vulnerability**: the propensity or predisposition
of exposed individuals or communities to be
negatively impacted, influenced by factors such
as age, health status, income, or housing quality.

In its initial release, *CLiVE* focuses on developing
indicators for the hazard component of risk. These
indicators are derived from satellite imagery and Earth
observation data, enabling consistent and scalable
assessments across subnational areas of the UK.
Specifically, the *CLiVE* toolkit includes heat stress,
flood risk and carbon emissions.

## Making satellite imagery data useful, usable and used

*CLiVE* is designed as an open, extensible platform
delivering data in accessible and friendly-to-use
formats. Future releases will incorporate indicators
of population exposure, such as residential density,
building typologies, or mobility patterns and social
vulnerability, drawing on demographic, social,
economic and infrastructure data.

The product will also expand its temporal resolution
(e.g. seasonal or monthly indicators) and geographic
scope (e.g. devolved administrations, national
comparatives), enabling both longitudinal tracking and
cross-regional comparison and analysis.
