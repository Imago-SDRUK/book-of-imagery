## Introduction

*SPF* (Sun Probability Framework) aims to measure sunlight exposure across the UK.

Sunlight exposure shapes human behaviour, health,
and wellbeing in profound ways. From mood and
physical activity to the price of houses, the presence
or absence of sunlight has measurable impacts on
daily life. Despite its importance, researchers and
policymakers have lacked accessible, high-resolution
data on local sunlight conditions.

Current approaches use regional data sets that are
too broad, or sun-angle calculations that can be
inaccessible and computationally expensive. The *SPF* toolkit addresses this
gap by translating complex satellite cloud mask data
into simple measures of sunlight probability at the
geographic scales researchers already work with.

## How do we do it?

*SPF* delivers processed sunlight exposure metrics
based on cloud cover data using Sentinel-2 satellite
imagery at 20-metre resolution, aggregated to
Lower layer Super Output Area (LSOA) boundaries
to match the geographic units used throughout UK
administrative data. We calculate this using cloud
mask layers, providing annual measures of sunlight
availability that can be directly linked to census data,
health records, survey responses, or any georeferenced
dataset using standard LSOA codes.

Integration requires no GIS expertise — researchers
and policymakers can merge exposure data with their
existing datasets through straightforward table joins
with geographic codes or administrative IDs. The toolkit
includes documentation, sample integration code, and
examples demonstrating the range of analyses this
toolkit enables. Future releases will expand coverage to
different aggregations and time periods.

## Why does it matter?

Understanding how environmental conditions like
sunlight affect human outcomes is essential for
both understanding our societies and designing
policy interventions targeting wellbeing and health
inequalities.

*SPF* makes satellite-derived environmental data useful,
usable and accessible for researchers working with UK
administrative data. Whether exploring seasonal mood
patterns, housing markets, or health service utilisation,
researchers can now incorporate precise, localised
sunlight measures into their analyses.
