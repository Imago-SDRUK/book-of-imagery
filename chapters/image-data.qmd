## Introduction
Imagine opening a photograph on your computer and zooming in until the image breaks into tiny squares. Each square is a pixel, the basic building block of any digital image. Satellite imagery works in much the same way, but rather than capturing a single scene, satellites record information about the Earth’s surface at a global scale. Each pixel represents a measurement of energy reflected or emitted from the ground, forming a raster grid that can be used to observe patterns across entire regions. These measurements extend well beyond the visible light captured in everyday photographs. Satellite sensors collect different kinds of information, including how detailed the image is (i.e., spatial resolution), how often a location is revisited (i.e., temporal resolution), which wavelengths of light are measured (i.e., spectral resolution), and how precisely brightness differences can be detected (i.e., radiometric resolution). Together, these characteristics allow satellites to detect changes and features that are not easily observed from the ground. Further, unlike surveys conducted from aircraft such as small or medium-sized planes, helicopters, or Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or through *in situ* fieldwork, satellite systems provide consistent, repeated coverage across large areas. This regularity and breadth of observation make them a powerful resource for studying social, environmental, and economic processes over time.

Since the launch of early spacecraft such as Sputnik 1 [^image-data-1] in 1957 and the first Landsat mission [^image-data-2] in 1972, satellite remote sensing has transformed dramatically. Advances in sensor technology, data transmission, and storage have expanded both the quality and quantity of available imagery. What began as a set of missions operated by a few national space agencies has evolved into a diverse ecosystem that includes government programmes, commercial providers, public–private partnerships, and constellations of small satellites [@undseth2021evolving]. Today, hundreds of satellites collect imagery with levels of detail and frequency that were technologically impossible only a decade ago.

At the same time, developments in cloud computing and machine learning have reshaped how satellite data are accessed and analysed. Large archives that once required specialist infrastructure can now be explored through online platforms offering scalable processing and near-real-time updates. For researchers, this means unprecedented access to timely, consistent observations of the Earth’s surface.

This chapter introduces the main types of satellite imagery, how they are collected, and the steps involved in preparing them for analysis. It also explains the rapidly evolving landscape of data access, including cloud platforms and licensing models, and highlights key ethical considerations that shape the responsible use of Earth observation. Throughout, the chapter emphasises how satellite imagery can support social, environmental, and policy research, providing readers with the conceptual foundation needed to choose, interpret, and apply these data effectively.

## Chapter Objectives

This chapter provides an overview of how satellite imagery is produced, accessed, and used in research and applied settings. By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to:

1. Understand core concepts and terminology related to satellite imagery, including key forms of resolution and what they reveal about the Earth’s surface.
2. Situate satellite imagery within the wider geospatial and social science data ecosystems, recognising how it complements more familiar sources such as surveys and administrative records.
3. Identify the main sensor types, satellite platforms, and missions, and assess their respective strengths, limitations, and relevance for different research questions.
4. Explain how satellite imagery is accessed, including the role of open-access repositories, commercial providers, cloud platforms, APIs, and licensing models.
5. Evaluate appropriate uses of satellite imagery for social, environmental, and policy applications, including how resolution choices, data characteristics, and ethical considerations shape what can be meaningfully observed.

## Fundamentals of Satellite Imagery

### Resolution Dimensions

Understanding resolution is essential when working with satellite imagery, and the concept is already familiar to social scientists even if the terminology differs. In many areas of social research, choosing the correct scale of analysis is a fundamental step. Studies may draw on individual-level data, neighbourhood statistics, municipal indicators, or national aggregates, depending on the question being asked. These decisions reflect an underlying concern with the appropriate level of detail needed to capture the processes of interest.
Satellite imagery follows the same logic. Resolution determines the scale at which features and changes on the Earth’s surface can be meaningfully observed. Selecting between fine, moderate, or coarse spatial detail mirrors the choice between analysing individuals, neighbourhoods, or cities. Temporal resolution parallels decisions about how frequently social or environmental processes must be measured, while spectral and radiometric resolution influence the types of distinctions that can be drawn within the data. In this sense, resolution is the satellite equivalent of selecting a unit of analysis: the choice that aligns the data with the processes under examination.

These four forms of resolution shape what satellite imagery can reveal and how it can support different kinds of research. Spatial resolution determines the level of visible detail, temporal resolution governs how often a place is revisited, spectral resolution enables the identification of surface materials and conditions, and radiometric resolution affects how precisely differences in brightness can be detected. Together, they influence whether imagery is appropriate for fine-grained local analysis, broad regional monitoring, or anything in betweeA summary of these differences is presented in @tbl-resolution_comparison along with a visual depiction of their main differences in @fig-imagery_resolution_types.

| **Resolution Type** | **Definition** | **Example Satellites / Sensors** | **Typical Applications** |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Spatial Resolution | Size of ground area represented by each pixel. | WorldView-3 (0.31 m), Sentinel-2 (10 m), MODIS (250–1000 m) | Urban planning, infrastructure monitoring, land cover classification |
| Temporal Resolution | Frequency with which a satellite revisits the same location. | PlanetScope (daily), Sentinel-2 (5 days with constellation), Landsat 8 (16 days) | Change detection, crop monitoring, disaster response |
| Spectral Resolution | Number and width of spectral bands captured. | Sentinel-2 (13 bands), Hyperion (220 bands) | Vegetation health, mineral mapping, environmental analysis |
| Radiometric Resolution | Sensor’s sensitivity to differences in reflectance or brightness. | Landsat 8 (12-bit), MODIS (12-bit) | Vegetation stress detection, water quality, surface temperature analysis |

Spatial resolution refers to the size of the area represented by each pixel in a satellite image, and it plays a role very similar to choosing the geographic unit of analysis in social research. Many social questions depend on understanding variation at a particular scale, and spatial resolution determines whether such variation can be meaningfully observed. High-resolution imagery, such as that from WorldView-3 [@WorldView], functions much like highly disaggregated neighbourhood data, allowing researchers to identify features such as individual buildings, small settlements, and small-scale infrastructure that are often missing from administrative sources. Medium-resolution imagery is comparable to ward or district-level statistics, supporting analysis of settlement patterns, land-use change, or urban expansion across broader areas. Coarse imagery resembles regional or national aggregates and is suited to large-scale dynamics such as climate patterns or vegetation change. For social researchers, selecting an appropriate spatial resolution is therefore a familiar methodological decision: matching the level of spatial detail to the scale of the social or environmental processes under study (see example in @fig-spatial_resolution).

Temporal resolution describes how often a satellite revisits and captures imagery of the same location. For many social and environmental questions, this is similar to deciding how frequently observations need to be collected in a survey or administrative dataset. High temporal resolution is valuable when processes change quickly, such as crop growth, flooding, or wildfire spread, because it allows researchers to track events as they unfold. Platforms like PlanetScope can provide near-daily updates, making them suitable for situations where timing is critical. Other missions, including Landsat, revisit areas less frequently and are therefore better suited to long-term monitoring where the priority is consistency over many years rather than rapid change [@wulder2012opening].

Spectral resolution refers to the range of information a sensor collects about how surfaces reflect or emit light. A helpful way to think about it is to imagine having multiple “layers” of data for the same place, each revealing a different aspect of the landscape. Some sensors collect only a few broad layers, which are useful for distinguishing major land cover types, while others collect many narrower layers that allow more detailed discrimination. For example, the different bands in Sentinel-2 make it possible to identify healthy vegetation, bare soil, water bodies, and built surfaces, while hyperspectral systems provide even finer distinctions. For social scientists, this means that spectral information can help identify land-use patterns, detect environmental stress, and map resources that are not visible in standard photography.

Radiometric resolution captures how sensitive a sensor is to small differences in brightness. In practice, this determines how well subtle variations in the landscape can be detected. Higher radiometric precision helps reveal gradual changes in vegetation condition, small differences in water quality, or variations in surface temperature. This can be particularly important in studies where small shifts matter, such as detecting early signs of drought stress, monitoring urban heat, or assessing the environmental impacts of development. Rather than focusing on the technical details of bit-depth, the key idea is that higher radiometric resolution provides a clearer and more nuanced picture of change.

Although presented separately, these forms of resolution work together. Most applications require balancing spatial, temporal, spectral, and radiometric considerations so that the imagery chosen matches both the scale of the research question and the nature of the phenomenon being observed.

### Sensor Types

Satellite sensors measure different kinds of energy reflected or emitted from the Earth’s surface, and each type provides distinct information about social and environmental conditions. Although the underlying physics can be complex, the practical distinction is straightforward: different sensors reveal different aspects of the landscape, much like how social datasets provide different perspectives on population, infrastructure, or economic activity. Sensors vary mainly in the wavelengths they measure and in whether they rely on external illumination or generate their own signal [@jensen2009remote].

Optical sensors record sunlight reflected from the surface in visible and near-infrared wavelengths, producing imagery that resembles photographs. However, they cannot *see* through clouds [@campbell2011introduction]. These sensors are widely used to map land cover, identify urban expansion, observe patterns of settlement density, and assess vegetation health, all of which are highly relevant for studies of urbanisation, land use, or environmental inequality. Radar sensors, including Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), operate in the microwave part of the spectrum and actively send out their own signal. Because they can collect data through cloud cover and at night, radar is particularly useful in regions with persistent cloudiness or during extreme events [@ferretti2002permanent]. For social researchers, SAR is especially valuable for mapping floods, monitoring infrastructure stability, or detecting changes that may signal informal settlement growth or land subsidence.

Thermal sensors measure heat emitted from the surface, making it possible to identify warm and cool areas. These data are useful for understanding urban heat islands, detecting wildfires, assessing energy efficiency in built environments, or examining temperature extremes that may affect vulnerable populations. Whereas hyperspectral sensors collect information across hundreds of narrow wavelengths, allowing for very detailed discrimination of materials [@richards2022remote; @goetz2009three]. While more specialised, these sensors can reveal subtle differences in vegetation stress, soil composition, water quality, or pollution, providing valuable evidence for environmental justice research, agricultural monitoring, or natural resource management.

A summary of these sensor types is provided in @tbl-sensor_types. Each type offers different strengths and limitations, and together they provide a suite of complementary tools that support decision making in areas such as disaster response, climate monitoring, land management, and urban planning.


| **Attribute** | **Optical** (e.g. Landsat 8 OLI) | **Radar** (e.g. Sentinel-1 SAR) | **Thermal** (e.g. MODIS, ECOSTRESS) | **Hyperspectral** (e.g. EO-1 Hyperion) |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Energy Source** | Passive | Active | Passive | Passive |
| **Wavelength Range** | Visible and near-infrared | Microwave | Thermal infrared | Hundreds of narrow spectral bands |
| **Key Capabilities** | Captures sunlight reflected from the Earth's surface to produce imagery comparable to photographs. | Transmits microwave pulses and measures the reflected signal to detect surface features and movement. | Measures heat naturally emitted from the Earth's surface, providing information on temperature variations. | Records continuous spectral data across numerous narrow bands, enabling identification of surface materials. |
| **Common Applications** | Land cover classification, vegetation health monitoring, urban growth analysis. | Flood mapping, ground deformation studies, forest structure analysis. | Wildfire detection, urban heat island assessment, thermal efficiency studies. | Precision agriculture, mineral mapping, environmental quality assessments. |
| **Strengths** | High spatial resolution and easily interpretable images. | Weather- and light-independent, consistent data acquisition. | Effective for identifying temperature anomalies and thermal patterns. | Fine-grained detection of subtle spectral differences among materials. |
| **Limitations** | Affected by cloud cover and requires daylight. | Complex to interpret, needs specialised processing. | Lower spatial resolution and less visual detail than optical sensors. | Large data volumes, sensitive to atmospheric conditions. |

### Key Satellite Platforms and Missions

Satellite imagery is produced by a wide range of organisations, from long-established national space agencies to commercial companies launching constellations of small satellites. Understanding this landscape helps social researchers identify which systems align with their questions, whether they concern long-term environmental change, rapid-onset crises, or fine-grained patterns of urban development. The field has expanded rapidly, and the combination of public and commercial missions now underpins applications across development, governance, planning, climate adaptation, and humanitarian response.

Government-funded missions form the backbone of global Earth observation, providing free, standardised, and long-term datasets essential for research and public policy. One of the most influential is the Landsat programme, which has operated continuously since 1972 [@USGS]. Its archive offers an unparalleled record of landscape change, supporting analyses of deforestation, urban expansion, agricultural dynamics, and coastal transformation over nearly five decades [@wulder2019current]. Building on this foundation, the European Union’s Copernicus Sentinel missions provide more frequent coverage and a broader range of sensing capabilities. Sentinel-1 supplies Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data that can image the Earth regardless of cloud cover or daylight [@drusch2012sentinel; @ESA], Sentinel-2 delivers multispectral optical imagery widely used for vegetation and urban monitoring, Sentinel-3 provides land and sea surface temperature and ocean topography, and Sentinel-4, Sentinel-5, and Sentinel-6 contribute atmospheric and sea-level measurements [@ESAallmissions].

Earth observation capacity now extends well beyond Europe and the United States. China’s Gaofen series provides optical and radar data suitable for land management and infrastructure monitoring. Japan’s ALOS missions contribute high-quality radar and multispectral imagery valuable for disaster response and forest mapping. Brazil’s CBERS programme, jointly operated with China, supplies medium-resolution imagery widely used across South America for agriculture, deforestation tracking, and environmental planning. These missions reflect the growing global diversification of Earth observation capabilities.

Before the emergence of new commercial players, the commercial landscape was dominated by “old space” companies such as Airbus and Maxar Technologies. These firms operate large, high-performance satellites designed for maximum spatial resolution. Maxar’s systems, for example, produce sub-metre imagery capable of resolving individual buildings, vehicles, and other fine-scale features. Such imagery supports disaster response, infrastructure assessment, security analysis, and detailed urban studies. These companies remain central to applications requiring the highest spatial detail and controlled acquisition conditions.

A newer generation of “new space” companies has since disrupted this model, relying on smaller, cheaper platforms, large constellations, and faster revisit rates. Many of these firms employ traditional sensor types on smaller satellites. For example, Planet operates a constellation of small optical satellites offering near-daily global coverage at approximately 3.7 m resolution [@curzi2020large; @Planet], while companies like Umbra deploy small SAR satellites capable of high-quality radar imaging. These systems trade extremely fine spatial detail for rapid temporal coverage, enabling the monitoring of changing phenomena such as crop cycles, flooding, wildfire progression, or informal settlement growth.

Other new space actors focus on novel sensing capabilities rather than scaling traditional ones. SatVu is developing high-resolution thermal satellites designed to capture heat signatures at unprecedented spatial detail, supporting applications ranging from energy efficiency to environmental monitoring. Several emerging providers are launching next-generation hyperspectral systems capable of analysing hundreds of spectral bands, allowing fine discrimination of surface materials relevant for agriculture, environmental health, pollution tracking, and natural resource management.

Together, public missions, old-space operators, and new-space companies offer complementary strengths: long-term continuity, high spatial detail, frequent revisit rates, and an increasingly diverse range of sensing technologies. This combination supports more flexible and robust analysis across disciplines. Live orbital positions of many satellites can be viewed on platforms such as satellitemap.space\footnote{https://satellitemap.space/}.

## Data Acquisition and Accessibility

::: {.column-margin .callout-warning title="Review comment"}
DAB: Add intro paragraph here introducing with a summary of the goals of this section. It's a really packed one and it can feel overwhelming.
:::

### Sources of Satellite Imagery

Satellite imagery is obtainable from open-access government missions and commercial providers. Public missions such as United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat programme and the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Sentinel satellites (part of the Copernicus programme) have played a crucial role in making Earth observation data widely accessible. These missions offer free, standardised, and globally consistent imagery that supports long-term environmental monitoring, disaster response, land use classification, and climate change research [@wulder2012opening; @drusch2012sentinel]. The Landsat archive, in particular, provides the longest continuous record of Earth’s surface from space, dating back to 1972 [@wulder2019current; @roy2014landsat].

In contrast, commercial providers such as Maxar Technologies and Planet Labs deliver very high-resolution imagery with more frequent updates. These images, which can capture detail as fine as 30 cm, are well-suited to applications such as infrastructure monitoring, precision agriculture, and emergency management [@belward2015launched]. However, this level of detail often comes at a cost. In this case, data from commercial providers is typically subject to strict licensing and usage fees, which can limit availability for academic or humanitarian purposes.

To bridge this gap, hybrid access models are emerging. Initiatives like NASA’s Commercial Smallsat Data Acquisition (CSDA) programme [@csda] and ESA’s Third Party Missions programme [@esa_third_party] allow researchers and non-profits to access commercial satellite imagery under subsidised agreements, expanding the reach of high-resolution data for scientific and public-good applications.

### Access Platforms and APIs

::: {.column-margin .callout-warning title="Review comment"}
DAB: I'd reword the title to "Accessing satellite data" and provide a more general overview: start with how EO data have traditionally been accessed, then moving to innovations like API's and cloud platforms, and then even add a paragraph about the new "cloud-native" generation of protocols (e.g., STAC) and file formats (e.g., COGs) that is more and more powering all offering of EO data.
:::

[MVP: Are we thinking in this chapter to start bringing examples how to access with specific examples on code snippets? Perhaps on GEE or Copernicus? Just wondering There are so many APIs, e.g. https://www.copernicus.eu/en/news/news/observer-data-cubes-enabling-and-facilitating-earth-observation-applications Are we describing all of them?]{.mark}

Cloud-based platforms and application programming interfaces (APIs) have significantly transformed how users access and analyse satellite data. Cloud-based platforms are online environments that store large datasets and provide tools for processing them remotely, removing the need for users to download large files or maintain powerful local computers. APIs are software tools that allow users to interact with these platforms programmatically, enabling them to automate tasks such as searching for images, retrieving data, and running analyses.

One such platform is Google Earth Engine (GEE), which combines an extensive archive of satellite imagery, including Landsat, Sentinel, and MODIS, with powerful cloud computing tools that allow users to process data at global scale without needing to download large files or maintain local servers [@gorelick2017google]. GEE provides a user-friendly JavaScript and Python API that enables both interactive exploration and batch processing of satellite data. This has opened up Earth observation to a broader community, including researchers, practitioners, and students who may not have access to high-performance computing infrastructure. Through GEE’s platform, users can perform complex analyses such as land cover classification, deforestation tracking, and climate monitoring across large spatial and temporal extents. The combination of open data, cloud-based processing, and accessible programming tools makes GEE a foundational resource in the modern remote sensing landscape [@zhao2021progress; @mutanga2019google; @cardille2024cloud].

Other platforms like the Copernicus Open Access Hub [@Copernicus] and USGS EarthExplorer [@EarthExplorer] provide direct access to raw imagery and metadata from Sentinel and Landsat satellites. These portals support browsing, visual inspection, and batch downloads, which are particularly useful for researchers. Further, commercial providers such as Planet and Maxar also offer APIs that allow users to search, request, and download imagery programmatically. Some APIs even support satellite tasking, allowing users to request a new image over a specific location. These tools enable integration into automated workflows, making satellite data more usable in machine learning models, urban monitoring systems, and near-real-time environmental applications.

As satellite imagery becomes more detailed and abundant, managing these large datasets using traditional methods is increasingly difficult. At the same time, the cloud model (i.e., cheap and abundant storage and compute rented on infrastructure managed by dedicated large companies such as Google, Amazon, or Microsoft) that has taken over other parts of computing and tech appears as a good fit to tackle the challenge. Cloud-based solutions address this by using formats like Cloud Optimised GeoTIFFs (COGs), which let users load only the parts of a file they need, improving efficiency and reducing the need to download entire images [@COG]. Further supporting these large datasets, platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Earth Engine, and Microsoft’s Planetary Computer now host massive archives of satellite data from missions such as Landsat and Sentinel. Tools provided by services like GEE allow users to search, analyse, and integrate this data into applications without needing their own servers.

Despite these advances, challenges remain. High storage and download costs can limit how much data users can afford to access. In addition, inconsistent metadata—how data is described and labelled—makes it harder to work across different systems. Most critically, access to cloud computing resources is uneven. Many researchers, especially in low-resource settings, may not have the internet connectivity or funding to take full advantage of these platforms [@lowndes2017our]. [DAB: I think it'd be worth expanding this paragraph a bit by tayloring it to social researchers. How do these general challenges map onto more specific issues social scientists experience when dealing with satellite imagery?]{.mark}

::: {.column-margin .callout-warning title="Review comment"}
DAB: 1. At some point in this section, it'd be good to add a paragraph on how this landscape of data access compares to that in the social sciences (where access mostly through the download of tables), what the key differences are, and some of the reasons behind it (e.g., data volume). This will help the reader connect with the message and relate to the new content. 2. I've brough into this section what used to be 3.4.4 because I think it fits the narrative and makes the text more coherent overall.
:::

### Licensing and Cost

::: {.column-margin .callout-warning title="Review comment"}
DAB: here again, it might be good to draw a connection to how licensing operates in the social sciences to help folks understand this landscape.
:::

Licensing models vary considerably and determine how satellite imagery can be used, shared, or modified. A licence is a legal agreement that outlines what users are allowed to do with a dataset. Open-access datasets, such as those provided by the Landsat and Sentinel missions, typically come with licences that permit free download, use, and redistribution [@wulder2012opening; @harris2015open]. These open licences promote transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration, especially in research and public policy contexts. Conversely, commercial imagery is often constrained by licences that prohibit redistribution or require substantial payment [@kim2024commercial], posing barriers to open science.

### Ethics

::: {.column-margin .callout-warning title="Review comment"}
DAB: this is super interesting and one of the areas where we have legit advantage in covering. I'd expand this section a bit more (one or two more paragraphs) and try to bring in conversation with ethics debates in the social sciences.
:::

There are also growing ethical concerns surrounding the use of satellite imagery. High-resolution images can capture detailed views of human activities and built environments, which may raise privacy issues, especially when the data are used in sensitive contexts such as humanitarian crises, armed conflict, or surveillance operations [@guida2021use; @avtar2021remote]. In addition, a broader debate has emerged around the concept of data colonialism. This term refers to the idea that access to valuable data, in this context, commercial high-resolution imagery, is often dominated by institutions in wealthier countries [@thatcher2016data]. As a result, organisations and researchers in lower-income regions may face significant barriers to accessing the data needed for critical decision-making, scientific research, or disaster response. These imbalances risk reinforcing existing global inequalities in knowledge production and technological capacity.

## Pre-processing and Calibration

::: {.column-margin .callout-warning title="Review comment"}
DAB: I'm not sure this should be a section of its own in its current state. Consider folding into other parts or removing. It is also a very technical aspect. If we're going to keep it, I'd suggest to frame it as the stuff end users don't typically have to worry but is crucial and is taken care of before end-users (at least social folks) touch the data. We could compare it a bit with the Q&A processes that surveys and censuses go through by the producer agencies before they're even released (they're obviously different processes but I think there's a parallel).
:::
[MVP: I can see here we are getting into processing and analyis- Does this fit here or as a seperate Chapter where we bring our training examples?]{.mark}

Before satellite imagery can be meaningfully analysed, it undergoes a series of pre-processing steps to ensure spatial accuracy, radiometric consistency, and suitability for the intended application. The main stages include:

## Georeferencing and Orthorectification

Georeferencing is the process of linking a satellite image to real locations on the Earth's surface so that every pixel corresponds to a specific point on a map. Orthorectification goes a step further by correcting distortions in the image that occur because the satellite was not looking straight down, the ground is uneven, or the Earth is curved. These steps make sure that features such as roads, buildings, or rivers are shown in the right place and at the correct scale. Without these corrections, measurements taken from the image could be inaccurate, which would affect tasks like tracking city growth, monitoring environmental change, or planning new infrastructure [@jensen2009remote].

### Radiometric and Atmospheric Corrections
[MVP: I would argue that we first do radiometric & atmo. cor and then geometric etc....This chapter should go first, strictly speaking]{.mark}

Over time, satellite sensors can lose some of their accuracy, and different sensors may record slightly different values for the same location. Radiometric calibration is a way of adjusting the image so that the brightness and colours more accurately represent what is really on the ground. Atmospheric correction deals with the effects of the air between the satellite and the Earth’s surface. Sunlight can be scattered or absorbed by gases, dust, smoke, or water vapour in the atmosphere, which can change the way surfaces appear in the image. These corrections help ensure that the colours and brightness in the imagery are as close as possible to reality, making the data more reliable for studying vegetation, tracking climate patterns, or mapping land use [@jensen2009remote; @campbell2011introduction].

### Cloud Masking and Data Fusion

Clouds and the shadows they cast can block important details in satellite images, making it difficult to see the land or water underneath. To address this, automated methods such as the Fmask system [@zhu2015improvement] can scan the image to find and remove the parts affected by clouds or their shadows. Landsat 8, for instance, also includes a dedicated Quality Assessment (QA) band that flags pixels affected by clouds, cloud shadows, snow, and other anomalies, which can be used to improve cloud masking [@missions2019landsat].

Another approach, called data fusion, combines information from different sources to fill in the gaps. For example, optical images (which rely on sunlight) can be merged with radar images (which can see through clouds), or multiple images taken on different days can be blended together. These techniques not only reduce the impact of clouds but can also make the images sharper, add more colour detail, or show changes over shorter time periods [@pohl1998review].

### Handling Noise and Inconsistencies

Satellite images can sometimes contain unwanted errors or ‘noise’ that make them harder to interpret. This noise might come from the sensor itself, interference from the atmosphere, or differences between images taken by different satellites or at different times. To improve image quality, specialists use various techniques to reduce this noise and correct inconsistencies. For example, filters can smooth out random speckles in radar images, and adjustments can be made to align images taken under different conditions. These steps help make the data clearer and more reliable for analysis [@maity2015comparative; @idol2017radar].

### Derivation of Indices

::: {.column-margin .callout-warning title="Review comment"}
DAB: I'd suggest to turn this into its own section (e.g., 3.7). This is very core to what Imago is about, and we should be able to write a good one on this that gives this step the relevance and credit we think it deserves. We will also be able to pull from all the experience in the product teams to write this well.
:::

[MVP: I understand that with IMAGO we talk about indices- I have a feeling that here indices are referred mostly to spectral band indices and band ratios, having said that we need to differentiate those temrs- perhaps call this sub section spectral indices or band ratios]{.mark}

Satellite images capture different types of light reflected from the Earth's surface. By combining these light measurements in special ways called “indices,” it becomes easier to see and understand certain features. One common example is the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which uses light reflected from plants to show how healthy the vegetation is. Healthy plants reflect more near-infrared light and less red light, so NDVI highlights areas with thriving greenery [@huete2002overview]. Other indices help detect water, assess fire damage, or identify urban areas. These tools turn complex satellite data into simple, meaningful pictures that support environmental monitoring and decision-making.

## Analytical Methods and Tools

::: {.column-margin .callout-warning title="Review comment"}
DAB: I think we should make this into a separate chapter. It feels like *so* much for a single one to cover properly. We will also be working more on this as we advance data products and workshops, and there's a lot of scope to do a really good job on this one. I'd suggest to take the content as it is now, and stuff it in a separate chapter on methods that we do *not* release officially on v0.1 in December, but that we keep to continue building on as we develop more workshop material, etc.

I think there's a really good opportunity here to turn this chapter into something super useful by presenting some of the standard stuff in satellite imagery but with a social science twist that really speaks to our audience and that cannot be found elsewhere. Let's build on top of this in that direction.
:::

Once satellite images are prepared, different techniques are used to extract useful information.

### Image Classification

Image classification is a way to sort parts of a satellite image into meaningful groups, such as forests, water bodies, or urban areas. Some techniques rely on examples provided by experts to “teach” the computer what each category looks like (supervised classification), while others automatically find patterns without prior examples (unsupervised classification) [@lu2007survey]. More recently, advanced artificial intelligence methods, like deep learning, have been used to improve accuracy by recognising complex patterns in high-resolution images [@li2018deep]. Figure 1 shows a recent 2024 land cover map for the UK that was derived from satellite imagery.

![[DAB:Caption?]{.mark}](images/land_cover_UK_2024.png){#fig:land_cover width="80%" fig-cap="Satellite derived land cover map for UK, 2024. Source: UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (https://www.ceh.ac.uk/data/ukceh-land-cover-maps)"}

### Change Detection

Change detection involves comparing images taken at different times to identify how the landscape has changed. This is useful for monitoring deforestation, urban growth, flood damage, or other environmental changes. Techniques range from visual comparison to GIS-based approaches [@lu2004change], to more recent AI and deep learning methods [@ding2025survey]. By spotting where and when changes happen, decision-makers can respond more quickly to issues or plan future developments.

### Object-Based Image Analysis

Unlike methods that classify individual pixels, Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) groups nearby pixels into meaningful “objects” based on their shape, colour, and texture [@blaschke2010object]. This approach is especially effective for identifying distinct features such as buildings, roads, or agricultural fields, providing more detailed and accurate results in complex environments.

### Time-Series Analysis and Spatio-Temporal Modelling

Time-series analysis examines satellite data collected over multiple dates to observe trends and patterns over time, such as seasonal vegetation cycles or urban expansion [@zhang2003monitoring]. Spatio-temporal modelling adds the dimension of space and time together to better understand how changes occur across different locations and periods.

### Software and Programming Tools

::: {.column-margin .callout-warning title="Review comment"}
DAB: I wonder if this sub-section could also be expanded into a separate (shorter) chapter on software and tools to work with imagery. Something like we did in the GDS book but for this context:

[`https://geographicdata.science/book/notebooks/02_geospatial_computational_environment.html`](https://geographicdata.science/book/notebooks/02_geospatial_computational_environment.html)

We will also have to build *something* like this for some of the workshops we'll deliver, so I think it makes sense to consider from the start as its own chapter we can point all sorts of folks to.

Specialised software and programming languages help experts manage, analyse, and visualise satellite data. Tools like QGIS, ENVI, and SNAP provide user-friendly interfaces for working with geospatial data, while programming languages such as Python enable custom analyses through libraries like `rasterio` [@rasterio] and `scikit-learn` [@scikit-learn]. Cloud platforms, including Google Earth Engine (GEE), have further expanded access by allowing large-scale processing without needing powerful local computers [@gorelick2017google].

[MVP: All the above sub sections look like seperate chapters but we don't want to end up generating chapter similar to any remote sensing textbook sowmehow it shoudl be linked to the products we produce right or to the concepts of social scientists- so I would call a chpater Object-based image analysis but something else that implements these approaches- I don't know what do you think?]{.mark}

## Summary

Satellite imagery offers a powerful way to observe and understand our planet from above, providing valuable information about the environment, cities, and natural resources. This chapter explored how these images are collected from both public and commercial sources, and the steps needed to prepare them for meaningful analysis. Ensuring accuracy through processes like correcting distortions and removing clouds is essential before the data can be used effectively. By applying various methods to classify land types, detect changes over time, and study patterns, satellite images become a vital tool for tracking environmental health, managing urban growth, and responding to natural disasters.

Beyond the technical details, the use of satellite data holds great promise for addressing global challenges. It enables better decision-making by offering a clear, up-to-date picture of complex landscapes at local and global scales. Cloud-based platforms and new technologies have made this information more accessible to a wide range of users, from scientists to policymakers. However, challenges remain, such as ensuring fair access to high-resolution data and respecting ethical considerations. Overall, satellite imagery represents an important resource that can help society monitor change, protect ecosystems, and plan more sustainable futures.
