## ✨ Acknowledging Contributors with All Contributors Bot

We celebrate all contributions! 🎉  
We use the [All Contributors Bot](https://allcontributors.org/) to recognize everyone’s work—code, docs, ideas, design, and more.

### How to Get Acknowledged

- After your PR is merged, comment on an issue or PR:
  ```
  @all-contributors please add @your-username for code, doc
  ```
  (Replace `@your-username` and the contribution types as appropriate.)

- The bot will open a PR to update the contributors table in the README.  
- Review and merge that PR to see your avatar and contributions appear!

### Contribution Types

See the [emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) for all the ways you can be recognized.

## 🔄 Resolving Merge Conflicts

Sometimes, your PR may have conflicts with the main branch. To resolve:

1. Fetch the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout my-feature-branch
   git merge main
   ```
2. Fix any conflicts in your files (look for `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` markers).
3. Add and commit the resolved files:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
   ```
4. Push your branch again:
   ```bash
   git push origin my-feature-branch
   ```
